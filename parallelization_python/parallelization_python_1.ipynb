    "`top` didn't show very meaningful output for the CPUI utilization, because I couldn't get runtimes of more than 1 second for the theading example without crashing the kernel by exausting the available memory. I assume that by using almost only `numpy` functions, which are implemented in C and not Python, the GIL doesn't slow down the execution and the overhead of theads is low compared to full processes. When using the slow pure python implementation, `multiprocessing` is obviously much faster than `threading` (~ 3.7 s to ~ 20 s). With threads, it's even slower than without parallelization."
